    Private Pilot License (PPL):
    The first step in your journey to becoming an airline pilot is to obtain a Private Pilot License (PPL). This license allows you to fly for personal and recreational purposes. To obtain a PPL, you must complete the necessary flight training and pass both written and practical exams. The course typically includes flight hours, ground school instruction, and solo flights.
    
    Night Rating (Optional but Recommended):
    While not mandatory, many aspiring airline pilots in Canada choose to obtain a Night Rating after getting their PPL. This rating allows you to fly during the night, which is an essential skill for commercial pilots.
    
    Commercial Pilot License (CPL):
    The next step is to obtain a Commercial Pilot License (CPL). The CPL allows you to fly for compensation or hire. To get a CPL, you must meet minimum flight hour requirements (e.g., 200 hours in Canada), complete advanced flight training, and pass written and practical exams.
    
    Instrument Rating (IR):
    The Instrument Rating is crucial for aspiring airline pilots. It allows you to fly in various weather conditions and rely solely on instruments for navigation. This rating enhances your flying skills and makes you a more versatile and employable pilot.
    
    Multi-Engine Rating (MER):
    Most airlines in Canada operate multi-engine aircraft. A Multi-Engine Rating allows you to fly these aircraft. It involves training on airplanes with more than one engine and learning specific multi-engine flying techniques.
    
    Airline Transport Pilot License (ATPL):
    The Airline Transport Pilot License is the highest level of pilot certification. To become an airline captain, you must obtain an ATPL. This license requires a significant amount of flight experience, specific training, and successful completion of written and practical exams. ATPL holders are eligible to serve as captains on large commercial aircraft.
    
    Jet Orientation Course (JOC):
    Once you're hired by an airline, you may undergo a Jet Orientation Course. This course familiarizes you with the specific procedures and systems of the airline's fleet and prepares you for operating jet aircraft.
